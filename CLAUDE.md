# CLAUDE.md — WebDesk Website Growth Dashboard

> Project memory. Read first at every session start. Keep it tight.

## Identity

- **Client:** WebDesk Solution (webdesk-growth-dashboard)
- **Project:** WebDesk Website Growth Dashboard
- **Build context:** nodejs
- **Project type:** custom-app-build
- **Project profile:** webdesk-growth-dashboard ← loads the profile at
  `webdesk-nodejs/skills/nodejs/projects/custom-app-build/profiles/webdesk-growth-dashboard/` after the base
  custom-app-build skill, per profile SKILL.md §2. **This file is the routing mechanism — the base
  orchestrator has no code that reads `project.project_profile` and auto-loads a matching profile.**
  If the "Required skill files" list below is ever removed or copied without the profile line, the
  profile stops loading silently.
- **Integration targets:** ["github", "wordpress", "google-workspace"]
- **Timezone:** America/Toronto (default — not yet confirmed by the client; see `docs/project-state/setup-input-register.md`) **Tenant:** per-client (single organization, no master/cross-client scope — see profile knowledge/05)
- **Host target:** vercel
- **Tech stack:** Node 24 + TypeScript + NestJS (Vercel Functions) + Next.js App Router;
  PostgreSQL (Vercel-provisioned, Neon excluded) + Sequelize; Vercel Queues/Workflows/Cron
  (no permanent worker); Vercel Blob; Google Workspace SSO + SMTP; GitHub App; Turborepo + pnpm
- **State file:** `outputs/webdesk-growth-dashboard/project.json`

## Required skill files for this project ← MANDATORY. The context allow-list.

> Load ONLY these at session start. Loading anything outside this list risks the 200K
> context wall. Never load another project_type's KB, another profile, or an integration
> target not listed above. See `_spine/shared-knowledge/context-budget.md` and this
> profile's `SKILL.md` §2 loading hierarchy.

Always (Tier 0):

- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/_spine/persona.md`
- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/_spine/shared-knowledge/CONVENTIONS.md`
- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/_spine/shared-knowledge/context-budget.md`
- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/_spine/shared-knowledge/model-policy.md`
- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/_spine/orchestrator/SKILL.md`

Active agent (one at a time):

- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/_spine/{active-agent}/SKILL.md` (e.g. `pm-agent`, `architect-agent`, `qa-agent`, `delivery-head`)

Node arm + custom-app-build + this profile:

- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/nodejs/SKILL.md`
- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/nodejs/projects/custom-app-build/SKILL.md`
- `webdesk-nodejs/skills/nodejs/projects/custom-app-build/profiles/webdesk-growth-dashboard/SKILL.md`
- profile `knowledge/*.md` file(s) the active task needs — see profile `SKILL.md §8` for the index
- profile `integrations/github/*` (only if the task touches GitHub)
- profile `integrations/wordpress/*` (only if the task touches WordPress)
- profile `integrations/google-workspace/*` (only if the task touches SSO/SMTP)
- profile `integrations/vercel/*` (only if the task touches Functions/Queues/Workflows/Cron/Blob)

On demand (Tier 2 — Read when the task needs it; do NOT preload):

- `webdesk-dashboard-documentation-v1/*` (the canonical dashboard spec, by path per the active task)
- `docs/implementation/*` (the compatibility review — by path)
- `docs/architecture/decisions/*`, `docs/contracts/*`, `docs/repository-plan/*`, `docs/security/*`,
  `docs/traceability/*`, `docs/phase-plans/*` (Phase 0 foundation — by path per the active task)
- `canonical-inputs/*` (WordPress Technical Discovery, Owner Clarifications, Agent Specification Batch 1,
  Service/SEO Library workbook — by path; the workbook is advisory only, never approved business truth,
  per WDS-014, regardless of what its own internal "Approval Status" column says)
- `outputs/webdesk-growth-dashboard/{HANDOFF.md, project.json}`

Do NOT load: `webdesk-nodejs/skills/nodejs/integrations/{bigcommerce,shopify,erp}/*` (not this project's
integration targets — see `SKILL.md §5` "Excluded"); any other project_type arm; any other project profile.

## Current state

- **Stage:** development **Current gate:** G-Schema (Phase 1B, passed 2026-08-07 — see
  `outputs/webdesk-growth-dashboard/project.json`'s `gates[]`, authoritative).
- **Active phase:** Phase 1B — Database foundation (Task 3), **approved 2026-08-07, scope Phase 1B
  only** (`docs/project-state/phase-1b-approval-checklist.md`, PR #5 merged). Real Sequelize/PostgreSQL
  connection, umzug migration framework, transaction and repository foundations — 19 unit + 8
  real-database integration tests — see `docs/project-state/phase-1b-validation-report.md`. **No
  business entity (`projects`/`users`) created** — only a test-only `_framework_probe` table proving
  the framework, per the task package's own two-tier gate. Phase 1A remains approved, scope Phase 1A
  only.
- **Blocked on:** see `docs/project-state/setup-input-register.md` for standing setup-time inputs. The
  Postgres Marketplace provider is resolved (Supabase, `us-east-1`) but **not provisioned** — every test
  ran against a local/CI disposable database. Google Workspace OAuth client, WordPress Application
  Password account, and real timezone confirmation still block Phase 1C+ tasks.

## Active tasks (this sprint)

1. A Phase 1C task brief (Google Workspace authentication, emergency local admin, session
   management) has already arrived, twice — its own stated precondition (Phase 1B approved, SHA
   recorded) is now met. Awaiting the explicit go-ahead to begin it.
2. Resolve remaining Phase 1C+ setup inputs in `docs/project-state/setup-input-register.md`
   (GitHub App creation, Google Workspace OAuth client, WordPress Application Password account).
3. Provision the actual Supabase database once Phase 1C or a later task actually needs a live
   connection — not before, and not automatically.

## Recent decisions

- `[2026-08-05]` Skill-overlay build completed — see `docs/skill-build/project-skill-build-report.md`.
- `[2026-08-06]` Phase 0 foundation authored: 20 ADRs, 7 integration contracts, repository plan, requirements
  traceability, security foundation, Phase 1 plan — all formalizing already-resolved architecture, not new
  decisions. See `docs/project-state/phase-0-validation-report.md`.
- `[2026-08-06]` Phase 0 signed off (scope: Phase 1A only) and pushed to `origin/main`. Phase 1A repository/
  monorepo foundation built and validated under that authorization — see
  `docs/project-state/phase-1a-validation-report.md`.
- `[2026-08-07]` Phase 1A signed off (G1 gate passed, scope Phase 1A only) — see
  `docs/project-state/phase-1a-approval-checklist.md`'s "Sign-off". PR #1 merged 2026-08-07.
- `[2026-08-07]` Phase 1B database-foundation task package prepared and approved (PR #2, merged) —
  see `docs/task-packages/phase-1b-database-foundation.md`. Documentation/planning only; Phase 1B
  implementation itself remains unauthorized.
- `[2026-08-07]` 9 transitive dependency vulnerabilities patched via bounded `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  overrides (PR #3, merged) — `pnpm audit` 35 → 18 findings. Two version-line decisions (NestJS
  10.x→11.x, Vitest 2.x→3.x) deferred pending review — see
  `docs/project-state/dependency-audit-2026-08-07.md`.
- `[2026-08-07]` Postgres Marketplace provider confirmed: Supabase, `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) —
  satisfies ADR-0007 (North America East Coast + not Neon, WDS-002). Chosen over the other
  verified qualifying candidate, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, by explicit project-owner decision.
  Not yet provisioned. See `docs/project-state/setup-input-register.md`.
- `[2026-08-07]` Phase 1B database foundation built and validated, per explicit user
  authorization ("Execute Phase 1B now") to execute the already-approved task package. Real
  Sequelize connection, migration framework, transaction/repository/health foundations — 19 unit
  - 8 real-database integration tests, migration up/down verified via both the compiled CLI and
    the Vitest-direct execution path. No business entity created.
- `[2026-08-07]` Phase 1B signed off (G-Schema gate passed, scope Phase 1B only), approved commit
  `80bd118b252ba2292af40d2ac8cecd217257ebc4` — see
  `docs/project-state/phase-1b-approval-checklist.md`'s "Sign-off" and `project.json`'s
  `gates[]`/`audit_log`. PR #5 merged. Phase 1C implementation remains a separate, not-yet-granted
  authorization.

## Open client blockers

- First-login provisioning model (JIT vs. pre-provisioned) — see profile
  `knowledge/05-google-workspace-sso-and-local-admin.md`. Owner: PM.
- ~~Actual GitHub repository URL~~ — resolved 2026-08-06, registered in `project.json` and as
  the local `origin` remote; confirmed real and reachable (Phase 0 pushed to `origin/main`,
  Phase 1A branch pushed and PR #1 opened 2026-08-06, merged 2026-08-07). Still unconfirmed:
  whether branch protection is configured on `main` (`docs/repository-plan/branch-and-release-plan.md`).
- ~~Postgres provider vs. Neon exclusion~~ — resolved 2026-08-07, Supabase/`us-east-1` — see
  profile `knowledge/01-approved-architecture.md` "Database" stop-condition for the rule this
  satisfies. Not yet provisioned.

## Cautions

- Do NOT design `dashboard-worker` as a persistent process — resolved decision,
  see profile `knowledge/04-serverless-queues-workflows-and-cron.md`.
- Do NOT use ACF anywhere in the WordPress repository — absolute rule, WDS-001.
- Do NOT select Neon directly as the Postgres provider — WDS-002.
- Do NOT wire Resend or any transactional-email API — WDS-004, use Google Workspace SMTP only.
- Do NOT conflate the software-delivery agent roster with the dashboard's 15 business
  agents — see profile `SKILL.md §6`.
- Do NOT create `projects`, `users`, or any other business entity in `packages/database` without
  a separate, explicit authorization beyond Phase 1B's own approval — the task package's own
  §9/§24 two-tier gate. `_framework_probe` (test-only) is the only table that exists.
- Do NOT provision the actual Supabase database (create the real project/instance) — confirming
  the provider (`project.json`) is not provisioning it; every test so far used a local/CI
  disposable database.
- Do NOT begin Phase 1C (Google Workspace authentication, emergency local admin, session
  management, per its own task brief) without a separate, explicit go-ahead — Phase 1B's approval
  clears that brief's stated precondition, but does not itself authorize starting Phase 1C.
- Do NOT treat `canonical-inputs/WebDesk_Service_SEO_Library_Templates_v4.xlsm` as approved
  business content — advisory sample data only, per WDS-014.
